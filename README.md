# Numpy Neural Networks:

To test my knowledge of backpropergation in FF and Convolution Neural Networks I decided to implement both from scratch withought any specific machine learning libraries like pytorch or keras. 

After doing so I trained FFNN and CNN models on the MNIST and Fashion_MNIST datasets to varying successes. 
Results can be found in the jupyter notebook.
